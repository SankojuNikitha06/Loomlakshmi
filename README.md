# LoomLakshmi — Weaving Empowerment with AI

# Overview
In many villages across India, saree weavers pour their skill and tradition into every thread, yet their hard work rarely brings financial stability. Limited access to digital tools, government schemes, and financial guidance keeps talented artisans disconnected from life-changing opportunities.
**LoomLakshmi** is an AI-powered digital companion designed to bridge this gap — helping rural weavers take control of their livelihoods through accessible, simple, and human-centered technology.
Built with **Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS**, the platform is lightweight, mobile-friendly, and optimized for low-connectivity environments.
